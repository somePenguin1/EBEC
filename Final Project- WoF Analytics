Assignment: m.n - WoF Analysis
Date: 12/20/2021

Description:
    A program that analyzes the letters for each word used in the Solo WoF project and finds the letter frequency for all
    26 letters and plots them on a graph.
Contributors:
    Name, login@purdue.edu [repeat for each]

My contributor(s) helped me:
    [ ] understand the assignment expectations without
        telling me how they will approach it.
    [ ] understand different ways to think about a solution
        without helping me plan my solution.
    [ ] think through the meaning of a specific error or
        bug present in my code without looking at my code.
    Note that if you helped somebody else with their code, you
    have to list that person as a contributor.

Academic Integrity Statement:
    I have not used source code obtained from any unauthorized
    source, either modified or unmodified; nor have I provided
    another student access to my code.  The project I am
    submitting is my own original work.
