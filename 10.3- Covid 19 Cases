Assignment: m.n - Covid 19 Cases
Date: 11/25/2021

Description:
    A program that draws the number of COVID-19 cases cumulatively in the state of Indiana from March 2020 until November 2021.

Contributors:
    Name, login@purdue.edu [repeat for each]

My contributor(s) helped me:
    [ ] understand the assignment expectations without
        telling me how they will approach it.
    [ ] understand different ways to think about a solution
        without helping me plan my solution.
    [ ] think through the meaning of a specific error or
        bug present in my code without looking at my code.
    Note that if you helped somebody else with their code, you
    have to list that person as a contributor.

    I have not used source code obtained from any unauthorized
    source, either modified or unmodified; nor have I provided
    another student access to my code.  The project I am
