Assignment: m.n - World Series
Date: 11/21/2021

Description:
    A program that looks at a file with all of the world series winners, asks the user for input, gets the team that won
    that year (if a game was played), and returns the number of times that team has won.

My contributor(s) helped me:
    [ ] understand the assignment expectations without
        telling me how they will approach it.
    [ ] understand different ways to think about a solution
        without helping me plan my solution.
    [ ] think through the meaning of a specific error or
        bug present in my code without looking at my code.
    Note that if you helped somebody else with their code, you
    have to list that person as a contributor.
