Assignment: m.n - Hello Turtle
Date: 10/18/2021

Description:
    Program that draws 'hello turtle' by using different functions to draw each letter.

Contributors:
    Name, login@purdue.edu [repeat for each]

My contributor(s) helped me:
    [ ] understand the assignment expectations without
        telling me how they will approach it.
    [ ] understand different ways to think about a solution
        without helping me plan my solution.
    [ ] think through the meaning of a specific error or
        bug present in my code without looking at my code.
    Note that if you helped somebody else with their code, you
    have to list that person as a contributor.
