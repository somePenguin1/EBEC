Assignment: m.n - Magic Square
Date: 11/01/2021

Description:
    A program that determines whether a list of numbers are a Lo Shu magic square by determining whether all the possible
    paths equal to 15 and if no number is repeating.

My contributor(s) helped me:
    [ ] understand the assignment expectations without
        telling me how they will approach it.
    [ ] understand different ways to think about a solution
        without helping me plan my solution.
    [ ] think through the meaning of a specific error or
        bug present in my code without looking at my code.
    Note that if you helped somebody else with their code, you
    have to list that person as a contributor.
